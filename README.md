Features
Chat with an LLM: Ask questions about the code, discuss features, and generate new code snippets.
Load any GitHub repository: Simply enter the repository URL and RepoChat will load the code and create a database for the LLM.
Easy to use: The web interface is simple and intuitive, making it easy to get started.
How it works
RepoChat uses a combination of technologies to provide its functionality:

Streamlit: A Python library for building web applications.
Hugging Face Embeddings: A library for creating vector representations of text.
Code LLaMA: A large language model specifically trained on code.
ChromaDB: A database for storing vector representations of code.
